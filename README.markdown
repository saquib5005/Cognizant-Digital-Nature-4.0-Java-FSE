  - Interface Segregation Principle
  - Dependency Inversion Principle
- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Creational**: Singleton, Factory Method, Builder
  - **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Proxy
  - **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command
  - **Architectural**: Model-View-Controller (MVC), Dependency Injection

### Module 2: Data Structures and Algorithms
Learn essential data structures, algorithm analysis, and their practical applications.

- **Algorithm Analysis**:
  - Time and Space Complexity
  - Asymptotic Notations (Big-O, Theta, Omega)
  - Best, Average, and Worst-Case Analysis
- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
- **Data Structures**:
  - **Arrays**: Traversal, Searching, Time Complexity
  - **Linked Lists**: Single, Circular, Double, Circular Double (Operations: Search, Insert, Traverse, Delete)

  - Variable Declaration, Data Types, Value Assignment
- **Control Structures**:
  - Conditional Statements (IF-THEN-ELSE, CASE)
  - Loops (FOR, WHILE, LOOP)
- **Error Handling**:
  - Predefined and User-Defined Exceptions
- **Cursors**:
  - Implicit vs. Explicit Cursors
  - Operations: OPEN, FETCH, CLOSE
- **Procedures and Functions**:
  - Creating Stored Procedures and Functions
  - Parameter Types (IN, OUT, IN OUT)
- **Packages**:
  - Specifications and Bodies
  - Benefits of Packages
- **Triggers**:
  - Types: BEFORE, AFTER, INSTEAD OF
  - Creating and Managing Triggers
