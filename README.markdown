## Overview

This repository is designed as a portfolio of core software development skills expected of a Java Full Stack Engineer as part of **Cognizant Digital Nurture 4.0**. Each week advances your expertise through focused modules, industry-oriented hands-on coding, and real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

- **cognizant week 1**
    - `Design Pattern/` – Java implementations of classic OOP design patterns.
    - `DataStructure And Algorithm/` – Solution projects using fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- **cognizant week2**
    - Projects on TDD, JUnit, Mockito, SLF4J Logging, and PL/SQL.
- **cognizant week3**
    - `Spring Core_Maven/` – Deep dives into Spring Framework core modules.
    - `spring-data-jpa-handson/` – Practice with JPA and ORM.
- **cognizant week4**
    - Spring REST API practicals and JWT authentication.
- **cognizant week 5**
    - Microservices projects, API gateway, and documentation.
- **cognizant week6**
    - Major React.js hands-on projects.
- **cognizant week7**
    - Advanced frontend challenges with React.js.

Each subfolder contains further organized code, practical scenarios, and (where present) project-specific READMEs and documentation.

## Weekly Roadmap

### Week 1: OOP, Design Patterns \& Data Structures

- **Design Pattern/**:
    - Java examples for Singleton, Factory, Builder, Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Observer, Strategy, Command, MVC, and Dependency Injection.
- **DataStructure And Algorithm/**:
    - Real-world projects such as:
        - Employee Management System, Financial Forecasting, Inventory and Task Management, Library Management.
        - Demonstrates searching, sorting, recursion, linked lists, arrays and time/space complexity.


### Week 2: Unit Testing, TDD \& PL/SQL

- **Advanced JUnit Testing**, **Mockito exercises**: Strong foundation in unit testing, mocking, and test-driven design.
- **PLSQL**: Solutions for basic to intermediate PL/SQL procedures/functions.
- **Logging \& TDD**: Illustrates SLF4J logging and best practices for TDD in Java.
- **README.md**: Includes detailed instructions, use-cases for each technology, and project setup guide.


### Week 3: Spring Framework Core \& JPA

- **Spring Core_Maven/**: Hands-on Spring Core concepts, Dependency Injection, multiple implementations of a Library Management system.
- **spring-data-jpa-handson/**: Focus on persistence, repository patterns, JPQL.


### Week 4: Spring REST APIs \& JWT

- Spring RESTful API hands-on projects.
- Implementations for multiple REST endpoints and workflows.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for robust authentication \& security.


### Week 5: Microservices \& API Gateway

- **microservices_project/**: Complete microservices reference architecture.
- **spring cloud microservices/**: Spring Cloud configuration, setup, and properties.
- API Gateway implementations for scalable cloud-native apps.
- Documentation file: **2. Microservices with API gateway.docx**


### Week 6: React.js Frontend Fundamentals

- Mixed project folder structure covering:
    - **blogapp/** (with full Create React App structure and README)
    - Cohort dashboard, trainers app, shopping app, counter app, cricket app, etc.
- Each directory illustrates distinctive React.js concepts and end-to-end scenarios.
- README and standard React development notes in key folders.


### Week 7: Advanced React Apps

- Question-oriented frontend apps (Ques 10–18).
- Focuses on advanced React patterns and complex UI challenges.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saquib5005/Cognizant-Digital-Nature-4.0-Java-FSE.git
```

2. **Explore weekly modules and projects:**
    - Each week’s folder contains submodules and ready-to-run projects.
    - Read any present README.md in subfolders for specific setup and demo instructions.
    
3. **Run Java projects:**
    - Open in your preferred IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse).
    - Build and run individual main classes, or use Maven/Gradle where applicable.
  
4. **Run React.js projects:**
    - Navigate to the relevant folder.
    - Install dependencies and start dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

    - Further details can be found in each React app’s README.md.
